# Next React Redux Boilerplate

Just a [next](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) boilerplate, for me mostly, to make a very quick react redux app.

## Usage

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jcblw/next-react-redux-boilerplate.git my-app
cd my-app
npm i
npm start
```

## Structure

[next](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) for more information on `pages` and `static`

#### Components

This is where all the components live at except the initial `page` component.

#### Store

The store directory is where there is the initial store file. You can place your reducers in this directory, or really anywhere you want :D

#### Base styles

There is a set of base styles these can be resets or anything you want to apply to the top level document.
